## Summary
This game is about you, a new vault hunter that is trying to stop two evil twins who are Sirens.  
A siren can be a random person but has special super powers and they themselves dont know their own purpose in the galaxy. You find a vault key on the planet where Borderlands 2 left off. For some reason the Vault Key has all the locations of the other vaults in the universe. As you find the vault key the two evil twins take the vault key from you and they tell you their master plan to take over the universe by finding the one vault that is hiding the most craziest powers in the universe. So you as the protagoists team up with other vault hunters to stop these evil twins by finding the all mighty super vault before them. 

They added some really good mechanics such as being able to slide and mantle over objects, this made the game a lot more fast paced and added so much more to the level design. For example, you can parkour around and find some good loot or you can mantle over objects and get to areas where you would not be able to do so in the past games.
The driving mechanics that have been in the past games feels smooth and great on this one. But the vehicles slide a whole lot and I feel like they could have done so much more with them to make them fit the planets that they are in. For example, 90% of the vehicles are used to get get you from point A to point B then thats all you use them for. There aren't any memorable momments with those vehicles, they feel like they are just there because the previous games had them.

Another cool mechanic is that they added specialties to certain characters in your story. For example, there is a character that is a Siren that has elemental super powers, there is a dude that can lay down a turrent that guns down enemies, there is another dude that can send a clone of himself, etc.. Although this spices the gameplay and replayablility up by a big margin, there are always going to be classes or characters that are overpowered and some classes/characters that are useless. A good example is the dude that clones himself, the clone becomes the main targets for AI until it is shot down. This sounds good on paper but during the gameplay it is extremely uselss since the health on the clone is super low and the cooldown on the ability is long. 

The biggest selling points for this game is the weapon drop mechanic. It was said by the developers that there are over one billion unique guns in the game. It is true by definition but in reality its just a crazy amount of duplicates with stat changes. For example, I'd find three of the same looking sniper with the differences of it being: the amount of output damage, fire rate, magazine size, ammo count, etc... 


## Final Thoughts

The story was not good but the gameplay was great, the story writting that gave Borderlands 2 the super satisfying and good feeling was not there. The dialog was not on par compared to the level of dialog of Borderlands 2. The Antagonists were super annoying. I beleive the villans were a parody of popular youtubers/streamers which already was a huge turn off. The whole story is based around beating the two evil twins from getting into a vault that has unimaginable powers. Since the game revolved around these two villans they would make un-necessary aperiences that added no good dialog to the story. There were other characters that you met along the way, but the writting on their dialog felt so dry and hollow. They didint really motivate you to actually care for them, they all felt like a chore throughout your journey. Although the the special characters, loot drops, and level design was a hugh improvement from the previous game. The story unfortunately is lacking the spark and enjoyment that the other two games gave us.
